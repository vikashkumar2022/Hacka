### Solution
"Our blockchain-based file security system provides cryptographic proof of file integrity using distributed storage and smart contracts, ensuring data authenticity and non-repudiation."

### Technical Innovation
- **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contracts for immutable file records
- **Distributed Storage**: IPFS for decentralized file storage
- **Cryptographic Security**: SHA-256 hashing for integrity verification
- **Professional Architecture**: Enterprise-ready microservices design

### Business Impact
- **Document Security**: Legal documents with verifiable integrity
- **Intellectual Property**: Proof of creation and ownership
- **Compliance**: Audit trails for regulatory requirements
- **Trust**: Immutable proof for business transactions
