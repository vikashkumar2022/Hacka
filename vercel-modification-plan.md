# Vercel Modification Plan (Not Recommended)

## Required Changes for Vercel Deployment

### 1. Frontend Only Deployment
- Deploy only the React frontend to Vercel
- Remove all backend dependencies from frontend build

### 2. External API Services
- Move Flask backend to Railway/Render/DigitalOcean
- Update API URLs in frontend environment variables
- Implement CORS properly for cross-origin requests

### 3. Database Migration
- Move from SQLite to cloud database (PlanetScale/Supabase)
- Update backend connection strings
- Handle database migrations externally

### 4. File Storage Solution
- Replace local file uploads with AWS S3/Cloudinary
- Update upload handlers in both frontend and backend
- Implement signed URL generation for secure uploads

### 5. Blockchain Services
- Use Infura/Alchemy instead of local Hardhat node
- Deploy smart contracts to testnet/mainnet
- Update Web3 provider URLs in frontend

### 6. IPFS Integration
- Use IPFS API services (Pinata, Web3.Storage)
- Remove local IPFS node dependency
- Update IPFS upload/retrieval logic

## Modified Architecture
```
Vercel (Frontend) → External API (Backend) → Cloud Database
                 ↓
              External IPFS Service
                 ↓
              Public Blockchain Network
```

## Estimated Development Time
- Frontend modifications: 2-3 days
- Backend service setup: 3-5 days
- Database migration: 1-2 days
- File storage integration: 2-3 days
- Testing and deployment: 2-3 days
- **Total: 10-16 days of development**

## Monthly Costs (Estimated)
- Vercel (Frontend): $0-20/month
- Railway/Render (Backend): $10-25/month
- Database service: $10-30/month
- File storage: $5-15/month
- IPFS service: $10-20/month
- **Total: $35-110/month**

## Recommendation: DO NOT PURSUE
This modification would:
1. Break your existing Docker-based deployment
2. Increase complexity significantly
3. Add monthly service costs
4. Reduce performance and reliability
5. Make local development more complex
