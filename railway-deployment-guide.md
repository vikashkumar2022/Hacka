# Recommended Deployment: Railway Migration Guide

## Why Railway is Perfect for Your App

Railway supports:
✅ Docker and Docker Compose deployments
✅ PostgreSQL databases with persistence
✅ Environment variable management
✅ GitHub integration for auto-deployments
✅ Custom domains and SSL certificates
✅ Full-stack applications with multiple services

## Step-by-Step Migration

### 1. Prepare Your Repository
```bash
# Ensure your code is in GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create Railway Account
- Visit https://railway.app
- Sign up with GitHub
- Connect your repository

### 3. Deploy Services
```bash
# Railway will detect your docker-compose.yml
# and automatically deploy all services:
# - Frontend (React)
# - Backend (Flask)
# - Database (PostgreSQL)
# - Redis (if needed)
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
```env
# Railway will prompt you to set:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  # Auto-provided by Railway
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-key
WEB3_PROVIDER_URI=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your-deployed-contract-address
```

### 5. Deploy Smart Contracts
```bash
# Deploy to public testnet (Sepolia recommended)
cd blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
# Copy the contract address to Railway environment variables
```

### 6. Update Frontend Configuration
```javascript
// Update API URLs in your React app
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-app.railway.app/api
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your-deployed-contract-address
REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID=11155111  # Sepolia testnet
```
